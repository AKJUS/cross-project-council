# Requesting Linux Foundation IT Support 

This guide outlines the procedures and best practices for requesting assistance from the Linux Foundation IT Operations team.

## Who Is This Document For?

This document is for OpenJS projects that have formally engaged with LF IT to support one or more of their services. If you have questions about a non-LF supported service, please contact operations@openjsf.org.

## How To Contact Linux Foundation IT For Support

### Submit a Ticket

The preferred way to request IT support is by submitting a ticket through the [Jira Service Desk](https://jira.linuxfoundation.org/plugins/servlet/desk/portal/2).

Submitting reqeusts via Jira ensures your request is properly tracked and assigned appropriately.

### What To Include

**Clear Summary:** 
A brief overview of the problem you're encountering. 

**Detailed Description:** 
Provide a comprehensive explanation of the issue, including: Error messages you're receiving (copy and paste if possible) Relevant logs or output Steps to reproduce the problem (if applicable) Links to failing workflows, pipelines, or jobs (if applicable)

**Expected Results:** 
Explain what you expected to happen instead of the issue you're facing. The more details you provide, the easier it will be for us to diagnose and address the issue effectively.

### Alternate Contact Method: OpenJS Foundation Slack

For less formal inquiries you can reach out to the IT Operations team channel (#lf-it-support) in the [OpenJS Foundation Slack instance](https://slack-invite.openjsf.org/).

Please note: While Slack can be a convenient way to communicate, submitting a ticket is the recommended method for official support requests as it allows for better tracking and prioritization.


### How Work Is Prioritized

Critical issues resulting in unplanned downtime will be prioritized over other severity types. Please clearly indicate the urgency of your request in the ticket description. Non-critical issues will be addressed according to their severity and order of submission. 

### How To Escalate An Issue In Jira

If your issue remains unresolved, you have the option to escalate it directly within the Jira Service Desk. This will bring your ticket to the attention of a senior IT team member.

## Have A Unique Situation?

For urgent, unique, or complex issues that require discussion, please contact operations@openjsf.org.
