# OpenJS npm Continuity Policy

## Summary

This policy is intended to ensure that OpenJS npm Organizations remain accessible and manageable.

It addresses the following use cases:

* Managing projects and users when maintainers are inactive or unreachable  
* [Deprecating packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/deprecating-and-undeprecating-packages-or-package-versions) when maintainers are no longer reachable  
* Adding or removing npm Organization members in emergency situations

# Continuity Options for Projects

### Option 1: Add an OpenJS Continuity Account to your npm Organization(s) and/or Packages

If you select this option a new, dedicated OpenJS account will be created specifically for your Project. This account will be managed by the OpenJS Executive Director (Robin Ginn, [@rginn](https://github.com/rginn)).

To initiate this process, please create an issue in the [Infrastructure repository](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/infrastructure/issues/new?template=IT-SUPPORT-REQUEST.yml).

* If you use npm Organizations, you will add this account to your Organization(s) and grant it the Owner role.  
* If you donâ€™t use npm Organizations, you will add this account as an Owner to your npm Packages.

### Option 2: Opt Out**

Projects that feel their governance is sufficient to provide continuity may opt out of this policy by requesting an exception from the CPC.

To initiate this process, please create an issue in the [CPC repository](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues).

- Organizations with 1-2 maintainers in the Owner role are the highest priority for this policy and are unlikely to be granted an exception.  
- Organizations with 3 or more maintainers in the Owner role who have been active in the past [6||12] months will be considered for an exception.
